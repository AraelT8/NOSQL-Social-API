# NOSQL-Social-API

## Description

This API powers a social network's backend, enabling users to share thoughts, interact with friends' content, and manage connections. Ideal for social media startups, it employs Express.js for routing, MongoDB for storage, and Mongoose ODM for handling extensive unstructured data. The models include User, Thought, and Reaction schemas. The server auto-syncs models with MongoDB on startup.

Insomnia Core facilitates testing of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users, thoughts, reactions, and friends. It ensures smooth data handling and formatting in JSON.
